##Building and sorting an array.
#Write the program we talked about at the beginning of this chapter, one that asks us to type as many
#Report erratum
#Prepared exclusively for Reed Kennedy
#A FEW THINGS TO TRY 66 words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just
#press Enter on an empty line) and then repeats the words back
#to us in alphabetical order. Make sure to test your program thor-oughly; for example, 
#does hitting Enter on an empty line always exit your program? Even on the first line? And the second? 
#Hint: Thereâ€™s a lovely array method that will give you a sorted version of an array: sort. Use it!
